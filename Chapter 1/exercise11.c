/* Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs
 * if there are any?
 *
 * Without type anything, the output should be 0 0 0.
 * The program does not know whether a input is a valid word, that is if you type any sequence of characters it will be counted as a word.
 *
 * The kinds of input most likely to uncover bugs are those that test boundary conditions like one of the two cited above.
