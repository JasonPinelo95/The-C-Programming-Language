# The-C-Programming-Language
Solutions to all exercises of the book The C Programming Language, 2nd edition of Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan.

The solutions of all exercises of the book are available here in the hope that my solutions can help the readers whether they got stuck in any exercise, or even to study purposes.

I cannot give to you any guarantee that all exercises are correct or in its full generality, and I hope to get contributions of people to fix where I made mistakes, to improve the solutions and turn it as simple as we can, to turn it readable and understandable for everyone.
